## System Overview

This is a complete AI-powered medical knowledge management platform with:

1. **Contextual Intelligence Engine** - Learns user patterns and predicts needs
2. **Self-Evolving Knowledge Graph** - Medical knowledge that grows and self-corrects
3. **Enhanced Research Engine** - Multi-source literature processing with conflict detection
4. **Adaptive Quality System** - Dynamic quality assessment that learns from outcomes
5. **Workflow Intelligence** - Predictive task optimization and resource management
6. **Advanced Conflict Detection** - Real-time contradiction identification
7. **Intelligent Synthesis Engine** - AI-powered content generation and synthesis
8. **Performance Optimizer** - Resource-aware processing and optimization

## Features

- **Always Learning**: System learns from every interaction and improves over time
- **Predictive Intelligence**: Anticipates needs and prepares information in advance
- **Contextual Awareness**: Understands your current work and expertise level
- **Quality Evolution**: Quality assessments improve based on real outcomes
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automatically detects and helps resolve contradictions
- **Resource Optimization**: Intelligently manages AI services and costs
- **Offline Capable**: Core intelligence works without external APIs
- **Self-Contained**: Complete system that deploys anywhere

## Getting Started

1. Copy the code files to your desired location
2. Set up environment variables (see deployment/.env.example)
3. Run with Docker Compose or install dependencies manually
4. The system will self-configure and begin learning from your usage

## Architecture Highlights

- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works great offline, incredible with APIs
- **Adaptive Performance**: Optimizes based on available hardware
- **Zero Lock-in**: Your data, your server, your control
- **Intelligent Caching**: Multi-level caching with compression
- **Circuit Breakers**: Automatic failure detection and recovery
- **Real-time Learning**: Continuous improvement from user feedback
